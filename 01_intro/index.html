<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>


<h4>Idea: Medical School Motivation Box (MSMB) </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A bit of context: I am going to medical school in the fall. People in medical school are big on using a spaced-repetition flashcard program called Anki to the point of 6 hours/day. Recently, I have also been bad at getting off of my phone at night. I don't feel there is a reason to be on my phone past midnight unless I am away from my dorm; therefore, a designated resting place (aka phone jail) that is time locked would be wonderful.


<p class = "margin"></p>

An idea for my final project is an Anki clicker and phone holder so after a certain time set by me or before a certain time using my phone is a nuisance (ex. audible alarm, push notifications on my phone). 
It would be great if there was a tracker for how long my phone is in the box each day and when. I would also want some kind of tracker for task lists so I can maintain an online task list while having a tactile way to mark completion for the task. This will help me focus on which tasks I want to complete each day and hopefully motivate me to do them. Inspiration below other images.

<br></br>

I would also love to add a fun animated reward for doing work. These "rewards" could be turned on at will or triggered by a lack of sensing of the Anki clicker in the holder and/or my phone in the box. Some ideas I have are a jellyfish lava lamp. While this would be cool as attached to the box, it might be better if they were not attached and instead the computer transmitted a wireless signal to turn it on.

Ideas of animated rewards in the real world are below:
