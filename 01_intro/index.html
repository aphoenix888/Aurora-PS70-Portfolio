<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : [INSERT IDEA 1]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

An idea for my final project is an alarm clock/phone holder so after a certain time set by me or before a certain time using my phone is a nuisance. 
It would be great if there was a reward tracker so so many days in a row of going to sleep/waking up early (8 hrs of sleep? per phone not in the or light level below a certain lumens) there was a rewards or stats could be tracked (like Anki) 

Add some fun animation/kinetic sculpture? Stars moving, sunfish, jellyfish, etc. cool jelly fish lava lamp that can be turned off

Add pomodoro or stopwatch to this? Sleep vs work settings? Time tracker?

Idea: Anki clicker lol

Make early sketches, think of skills to learn, see what is currently out there
