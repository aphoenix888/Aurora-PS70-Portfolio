<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

This week, we learned how to solder and soldered our Xiao microcontrollers together. I used this to power my kinetic sculpture.

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

For my kinetic sculpture, I initially wanted to make a jellyfish lava lamp. My first thought was to use a peristaltic pump to blast pulses of water, but a lack of ability to turn the pump on and off made me pivot to a mechanical up and down inspired by the snail cam in the gear workshop.

After settling on this design, I started sketching ideas and figuring out what I needed to cad.

Here is the prototype of gears and 


After some testing, I realized I forgot to to align the gears vertically and the small gear on the motor was catching on the box. This led to a new base design. The gear attachment to the motor was also failing and spinning, so I decided to print them out of wood. At this point, there was a cardboard shortage so I made the gearbox out of wood too. I actually really liked using wood and hope to make a nicer looking base out of wood.



Here is the jellyfish moving!

Shoutout Bobby for a lesson in how gears work and Victor for late Science Center office hours. Also shoutout Alice for being a good work buddy!

In the future, I hope to place the jellyfish in water, add lights to make the jellyfish glow, and test to make the jellyfish movement as realistic as possible. I also hope to modify the design to be more easily modifiable.
